        "q1": { "type": "question", "settings": { "category": "Product & Safety", "question": "Is Lom Thai actually safe?", "answer": "5 ingredients. All plant-based. Used by millions in Thailand for over a century. It's not a drug, medication, or supplement — it's a natural herbal aromatherapy stick used through inhalation and topical application. As with any product, discontinue use if irritation occurs." } },
        "q2": { "type": "question", "settings": { "category": "Product & Safety", "question": "How is this different from Vicks?", "answer": "Vicks is petroleum-based with synthetic menthol. Lom Thai uses pure plant extracts — menthol, camphor, eucalyptus, borneol, and lemon — in a century-old Thai formula. Different universe. Thai herbalists perfected this blend generations before Vicks existed." } },
        "q3": { "type": "question", "settings": { "category": "Product & Safety", "question": "What are the ingredients?", "answer": "Menthol (40% concentration — 3x industry standard), camphor, eucalyptus oil, borneol, and lemon oil. All plant-based, all naturally sourced. Nothing synthetic, nothing artificial, nothing you can't pronounce." } },
        "q4": { "type": "question", "settings": { "category": "Product & Safety", "question": "Is it TSA / airport safe?", "answer": "Yes. It's a solid stick, well under any liquid limits. Thousands of our customers fly with it. Pocket-sized, flight-friendly, and the only thing you'll actually want to pack." } },
        "q5": { "type": "question", "settings": { "category": "How to Use", "question": "How do I use it?", "answer": "Two ways: Top end is a nasal inhaler — breathe in the aromatic herbal blend for a refreshing sensation. Bottom end is a rollerball applicator — roll onto temples, neck, or under your nose. Two tools, one pocket-sized stick." } },
        "q6": { "type": "question", "settings": { "category": "How to Use", "question": "How quickly can I feel the aroma?", "answer": "The aromatic experience is immediate — one inhale and you'll notice the herbal blend. Many people in Thailand have traditionally used this type of inhaler throughout their day for a refreshing sensation." } },
        "q7": { "type": "question", "settings": { "category": "How to Use", "question": "How long does one stick last?", "answer": "Several months with daily use. One $8 stick delivers premium relief longer than a month's worth of energy drinks or pharmacy sprays — for a fraction of the cost." } },
        "q8": { "type": "question", "settings": { "category": "How to Use", "question": "What's the difference between the two ends?", "answer": "Top end: nasal inhaler — breathe in the aromatic herbal blend for a refreshing sensation. Bottom end: rollerball applicator — roll onto temples, neck, or under your nose. Two tools, one pocket-sized stick." } },
        "q9": { "type": "question", "settings": { "category": "Shipping & Returns", "question": "Do you ship internationally?", "answer": "Free US shipping (5-7 business days). Free EU shipping (5-10 business days). Ships within 24 hours. Every order is backed by our 30-day money-back guarantee, no matter where you are." } },
        "q10": { "type": "question", "settings": { "category": "Shipping & Returns", "question": "What if it doesn't work for me?", "answer": "Email us. Full refund. No forms, no shipping it back, no 'restocking fee.' 97% of people keep it — but if you're in the 3%, we'll make it right without a single question." } },
        "q11": { "type": "question", "settings": { "category": "Shipping & Returns", "question": "How do I track my order?", "answer": "You'll receive a tracking email as soon as your order ships (within 24 hours). You can also visit our Track Order page anytime to check your delivery status." } },
        "q12": { "type": "question", "settings": { "category": "Shipping & Returns", "question": "What's your return policy?", "answer": "30-day money-back guarantee on every order. No forms, no shipping it back, no questions asked. Just email us and we'll refund you. We can afford this because 97% of people keep their Lom Thai." } }
