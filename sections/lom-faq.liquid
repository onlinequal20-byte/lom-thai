It's not a drug, medication, or supplement — it's a natural herbal aromatherapy stick used through inhalation and topical application. As with any product, discontinue use if irritation occurs." } },
        { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "How is this different from Vicks?", "answer": "Vicks is petroleum-based with synthetic menthol. Siam Lom uses pure plant extracts — menthol, camphor, eucalyptus, borneol, and lemon — in a century-old Thai formula. Different universe. Thai herbalists perfected this blend generations before Vicks existed." } },
        { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "What if it doesn't work for me?", "answer": "Email us. Full refund. No forms, no shipping it back, no 'restocking fee.' 97% of people keep it — but if you're in the 3%, we'll make it right without a single question." } },
        { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "Do you ship internationally?", "answer": "Free US shipping (5-7 business days). Free EU shipping (5-10 business days). Ships within 24 hours. Every order is backed by our 30-day money-back guarantee, no matter where you are." } },
        { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "How quickly can I feel the aroma?", "answer": "The aromatic experience is immediate — one inhale and you'll notice the herbal blend. Many people in Thailand have traditionally used this type of inhaler throughout their day for a refreshing sensation." } },
        { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "How long does one stick last?", "answer": "Several months with daily use. One $8 stick delivers premium relief longer than a month's worth of energy drinks or pharmacy sprays — for a fraction of the cost." } },
        { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "Is it TSA / airport safe?", "answer": "Yes. It's a solid stick, well under any liquid limits. Thousands of our customers fly with it. Pocket-sized, flight-friendly, and the only thing you'll actually want to pack." } },
        { "type": "question", "settings": { "question": "What's the difference between the two ends?", "answer": "Top end: nasal inhaler — breathe in the aromatic herbal blend for a refreshing sensation. Bottom end: rollerball applicator — roll onto temples, neck, or under your nose. Two tools, one pocket-sized stick." } }
